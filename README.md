The package `trimcluster` performs k-means clustering. The method is
described in Cuesta-Albertos et al.Â (1997) <doi:10.1214/aos/1031833664>.

## Installation

The `trimcluster` package is on CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive
Network) and the latest release can be easily installed using the
command

    install.packages("trimcluster")
    library(trimcluster)

## Building from source

To install the latest stable development version from GitHub, you can
pull this repository and install it using

    ## install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("valentint/trimcluster"

Of course, if you have already installed `remotes`, you can skip the
first line (I have commented it out).
